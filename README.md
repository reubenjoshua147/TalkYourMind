# TalkYourMind
But I don’t 
Crypto is a journey that start, will later end as




Exchange that comes as a solution, and until everyone has the knoweldege of crypo-currency and how we can individual trade our exchange it's keeps growing. And you may ask yourself then why has everyone not gotten the knowlege of this crypo-currency or why have I not gotten the idea about this currency, Please the answer is, crypo-currency is a journey but it's operate whether there is an acceptance or not. It's needs it

I think naturally in this world we are created not to always get in conclusion with each others. Yes, and both parties may have a solid reason why they either see each other differently. That is why if you ask someone to mine any crypto currency the person may either have a solid reason as to why he/she will not mine a currency he has no knowledge about. And please let’s take note of the word mine. If you meet another person, the person he or she may give you a 100% why he sees crypto mining as an opportunity.


So what are the factors that can make both parties agree on one thing?

Sicknesses 
Inflation 




it will not only drive the people's mentally from the government. But gives hopes. what everyone should hope and expect for at the end of every four years. And there is a full knowledge of crypto currency. Now let me ask you, do you feel any change within you? Well yes, that's how Nigeria and the world at large will feel.



But I don’t know what I will do to the country who accept “Talk your mind” because it team works.

But I tell you it’s not going to be easy. What I want is, first the government should please consider the interest of allowing this coin in their country and the ones who will be patient to mine for 8 years.


But if the people don’t see crypto as an opportunity maybe the government should me and not fight me.




But you are really free to say whatever you like about the coin. I think that’s what this about 



Listen and listen very carefully. Talk your mind is not for everyone. But to those who have hope of surviving tomorrow chance of surviving if there is tomorrow. But I swear crypto is an opportunity given to the poor. The hopeless, only to those who can be consistent in nothing. But it’s doesn’t just start. It has to begin somewhere. And I think in a country not just Nigeria 🇳🇬 we all need it. But I tell you from my heart. It’s not going to be easy. But please and please I am begging on the Nigeria 🇳🇬 Government to give us a chance. We that are consistent in doing nothing. 8 years have passed can we survive another 8 years when there is no hope for the people. I think the Federal government should please 🙏 give us a chance and not kill us before even we are born. But if we succeed, any country who supports this “Talk your mind project well a coin is too big for one person to own. But I need help not financially but a freedom in democracy where the Talk your mind can be mined safely in Nigeria and other countries who will accept this coin from harressment. Like a form of protection but you see that is where the government comes in. But if this coin is what the people want 

Believe me I would love to say both the government and people have the same rights. But I’m afraid not in Nigeria 🇳🇬. I haven’t been to other countries so I will not talk about other countries I don’t know 


But I bet, it will be outsiders that will see if sitting less one day to wait patiently to hit your mine button. 


To be a man you must never make excuses. I think that is what makes us a man. So irrespective of what you may think of it as an excuse. It’s won’t count you as a man. I have said my mind. Now I am waiting for you to say yours.



But first the Pi coin is almost at the peak of its launching. It’s three months from now. Please I would prefer to have the people with me and let the government do the deciding if the will accept “Talk your mind as a coin in Nigeria 🇳🇬. But please 🙏 let’s watch and see how pi will turn out to be. If the project is lunched successfully. I think we need a coin in Nigeria 🇳🇬 as a new point of hope for ….. people who can be consistent doing nothing, what they know it can be achieve in the future. But I will give the people the chance to tell me the word for it. Because honestly I don’t know.




Tym because mining takes time. I didn’t say it will be easy. And that’s why I said it’s for the consistency tiredness people who have dream of surviving tomorrow with no ability to earn a living but can live and click for a day. 


But just the ability of consistently clicking the mine button.

But for people who believe this project far and near. Talk your mind says it’s will always see how it can help the society at large because it’s will be the talk of minds. I just hope to see us all alive there.




It’s just a proposal and advertisement.

Talk your mind 

I’m just saying the government should remember this if they can approve the mining of Tym in Nigeria 🇳🇬 please they should be glad they have done so much for the people. Yes to the people. Because believe me we are all suffering but some people prefer to nothing about something. So, like I said leaders who can speak our minds will know that a coin like talk your mind is what we need now in this country.


But anything wey you Dey do, no forget to add pi and make people use your referral code.



What is a token ?

Crypto is the only chance if we have to survive.
The movement is on. And


A boy asked me what makes up a man or I think the question was what makes a man successful. And my answer to him is. It is so many things. But the idea and the people is what makes up a man. A successful man if he she can actually tell you the secret of being successful

Why I want Nigeria 🇳🇬 government and every ruling organized Government to accept crypto currency and accept the “Talk your mind token “ into consideration is, it will not automatically change Nigeria automatically but I will tell you 8 years from now. Nigeria will feel a little step forward in the government and it is what we need right now. Please if you be president we know you are a president, if you are a police officer we know you a an Nigeria 🇳🇬 army we know we know you are our Nigeria 🇳🇬 army. But those in power, please can you be submissive to your own self? Okay let just forget about the people. Please it’s time we submit to our own self. Because when you are submit to your self there are some things you consider good for your own self. So do you know how much more your own submissiveness will benefit your neighbor?

Okay take for an example you live in a yard of let’s just say two bedroom apartment and a one bedroom flat apartment. And you take a broom one day and sweep the entrance to your compound one day. And you do it again maybe a week or two after that one because you are not entitled to do so. And you continue just like that. You are not only sweeping little broken object we cannot see on the ground that may harm if you dare go on barefoot. That same object can hurt your tires if you have a vehicle. You see how much benefits the sweeping does for you yourself. So how much more the owner of the compound will feel about it. He may not tell you but you see sometimes in life we fail to see the benefits doing a particular thing can do for us first but no, we see how good and beneficial it will for your neighbors. 

This same instance is applicable to crypto currency when it comes to mining a coin. 
But I don’t know. That is why you need to talk your mind how you feel about our government and its people start sweeping for crypto currency’s. But this message is not for Nigeria alone. But my fat and near brothers who are hearing my voice today




For now the Talk Your mind token is not yet in the market neither 

But I understand that the crypto system is a journey. And it’s the movement that we are into. For me the greatest thing a man should every man needs to reached out for is expectation. The problem is the people are expecting the government to do something. But what if the government is more broken and is not complaining. So, we are just telling the world that a token like this will be out. it’s a journey 


A piece of advise to our elderly? They should not embark on crypto because I don’t think they will be in our future. But the ones that enjoy doing nothing out of something should come here. Mine. I stand sometimes and asked myself that had it been I was eight. And let’s just say token comes out every eight years. Like at the end of each 8 years a token will be launched either globally or national but crypto currencies is not owned by anyone and it’s not controlled by the government. But we know our Father Elon Musk. 



Crypto currency mining. 

So crypto currency mining is hereby defined as the general input in labor called mining in a token or crypto before decentralize And in turn paid for their hard work with the currency when decentralized. 



But I defined cryptocurrency mining as an opportunity or a way of digging yourself out of economic growth. 


Have you ever heard a man said, things don’t used to be like this for me oh? Have you heard any? And maybe this person is working as a security guard where he/she is been paid #25,000 (Twenty five thousand Naira? Now let me ask you, with the current economy with these person be able to cover up his rent, meet up with savings, Carter for his/her family without running into debt? Well, naturally the answer is, any one of this is more likely to happen. But in a system of government where there is new project of cryptocurrency in Nigeria🇳🇬 and any other country Globally the Government is more likely to have a change but in the future.
